                <h3 class="mt-4">Who Can Apply For Work Experience?</h3>
                <p>
                    You need to be between 16 and 24 to take part in work experience with futureCoders. You will be gaining work experience as
                    a 'junior developer'. Being able to programme is essential. If you haven't learnt yet, you could join
                    one of our coding workshops which will help you to start learning on your own as well as with others.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Would I Want To Do This Type Of Work Experience?</h3>
                <p>
                    You will be a full member of our development team and will play your part in getting our projects delivered. This is a unique
                    opportunity to learn what it is like to work in the software development industry, to make new friends
                    and to be part of making something for a good cause.
                </p>
                <h3>What Is Involved In Work Experience?</h3>
                <p>
                    You will commit to working each Saturday and one evening during the week in our Chatham office. You will be a full member
                    of our development team and will play your part in getting our projects delivered. You will be expected
                    to work remotely for a further half day on your code. This commitment is expected for a minimum of three
                    months, for the full life of the project. This is a unique opportunity to learn what it is like to work
                    in the software development industry, to make new friends and to be part of making something for a good
                    cause.
                </p>
                <h3>How Do I Apply For A Place On The futureCoders Work Experience Programme</h3>
                <p>
                    The application process opens up before each new project. For information on when the next application window will be open
                    please contact us via
                    <a href="mailto:karen@futureCoders.org.uk" target="_top">email</a> to find out more.
                </p>
                <h3>I Haven’t Done Any Coding Before. Can I Still Apply?</h3>
                <p>
                    We need people with programming experience to pair program with students and to do code reviews. We need volunteers to help
                    at Coding Workshops and Project workshops (where students bring along their own coding projects and we
                    support). We need volunteers to come along to events to help make sure that our staff are supported.
                    We need volunteers to take on various project roles (UX, UI, project management, scrum master, testing,
                    etc). If you are interested, please get in touch: email karen@futurecoders.org.uk to arrange to chat
                    further.
                </p>
                <h3>I Am A Developer And Would Like To Get Involved. What Should I Do?</h3>
                <p>
                    That is fantastic. Have a look at the question below on volunteer roles and
                    <a href="mailto:karen@futurecoders.org.uk" target="_top">email</a> us to arrange for a chat.
                </p>
                <h3>I am a Computer Science/IT teacher. Can I get involved?</h3>
                <p>
                    A futureCoders project is a great way for a teacher of computer science/IT to get teeth into a real project and to develop
                    new skills in a supportive environment. A teacher would make a great volunteer and this would be a great
                    CPD opportunity. If you are interested and would like to discuss this, please send us an
                    <a href="mailto:karen@futurecoders.org.uk" target="_top">email</a> We would love to hear from you. We promise not to put you in a team with your own students.
                </p>
                <h3>I Would Love To Volunteer To Help. What Can I Do?</h3>
                <p>
                    We need people with programming experience to pair program with students and to do code reviews. We need volunteers to help

                <h3>My Company Would Like To Get Involved. What Should I Do?</h3>
                <p>
                    That is fantastic. There are many ways in which companies can support our work. Could you loan us a developer? Could you
                    host a project in your office space? Could you host an event? Could you take on a futureCoders 'graduate'
                    for further, different work experience? Could you consider a futureCoders 'graduate' for a job or apprenticeship?
                    Could you sponsor a student through the programme (it costs a minimum of £250 per student per month to
                    put them through the programme)? Please contact us via
                    <a href="mailto:karen@futurecoders.org.uk" target="_top">email</a> to discuss possible options.
